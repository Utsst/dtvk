## Overview

The DTV Kit features a fully autonomous driving vehicle, designed for developers, universities, and research institutions. It serves as a comprehensive teaching kit, dedicated to cultivating talent in the autonomous driving field and supporting the global academic and research communities. The platform accommodates both closed-loop autonomous driving scenarios and modular secondary development, delivering a highly adaptable solution for educational and research purposes.

### Open platform
DTV is an industry-first open autonomous driving educational vehicle that transforms the traditionally closed "black-box" system into a transparent "white-box" model. By fully exposing the drive-by-wire protocol, sensor drivers, and complete software stack, it enables users to delve into the principles and inner workings of each module. 

### Designed for teaching and research
Designed to meet the needs of both academic and industry training programs, DTV is a flexible and scalable platform for cultivating talent in autonomous driving. It enables users to interact with and experiment across various components of the system.

### Robust configuration
The DTV is built on a robust skateboard chassis, offering both structural strength and a sleek, futuristic aesthetic. Its high-strength metal truss enhances durability, while the thoughtfully designed sensor layout — including cameras, LiDARs, and navigation systems — ensures a wide field of view. Precise sensor calibration techniques contribute to reliable and accurate data output. Additionally, a quick-attach mounting system allows for easy sensor configuration and expansion.

### Flexibile driving modes
The DTV offers four driving modes to support a range of testing and development needs: autonomous driving using Autoware; manual driving via a steering wheel and pedals; teleoperation using an industrial remote control: and remote operation. These modes give users the flexibility to select the most appropriate option for their specific use case, whether in research, development, or testing scenarios.
