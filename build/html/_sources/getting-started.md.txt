### Safety tips for teleoperation
Users must familiarize themselves with the remote controller before entering autonomous driving mode, especially the emergency stop function.

- When turning the remote controller on and off, ensure that all function buttons are in the off state, for example, parking, neutral gear, remote control mode, and no throttle.
- Verify that all buttons are functional before operating the vehicle.
- When in remote control mode, do not push the throttle to its maximum level in one go to avoid potential accidents. Throttle control should be gradually applied.
- When operating in an open area, ensure that the remote controllerâ€™s working range does not exceed 100 meters.
- After stopping the vehicle, ensure that the vehicle is in neutral gear and the handbrake is engaged. Avoid parking on slopes.
- Users must must carefully read the instructions before use. People unfamiliar with the controls should not operate the vehicle, as this may result in accidents.

Both the remote controller system and the vehicle's VCU layer assign absolute priority to the remote control receiver. ==And the basic rule is that under any condition of the vehicle's chassis (ensure the remote controller is charged before each operation), as long as the remote controller is powered on and in remote takeover mode, the vehicle chassis will enter manual takeover mode.== This ensures safety during development and testing.
